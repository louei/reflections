--What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates an empty repository and a meta data file .git.we want to group 
related files and put them inside of the same repository
--How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
it is helpful to commit all the files at the same time. since it is better
to have a logical change for every add we use one add command for every change
but in commit we commit all of them at the same time.
