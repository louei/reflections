by seeing where there is a typo we can get rid of the bug
--What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you 
do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
if you forget to save your commits then you have lost all of your work
manually saving can make you loos your concentration and also you save 
it a lot of times.
--Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one 
commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
to save related files at the same time;to save time
--How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
we use git log to find the ID of the commits then by using git diff and passing their 
IDs to get diff, we can find the differences between those
--How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
by using git checkout command i always can return the correct code

i want to try it for my codes
