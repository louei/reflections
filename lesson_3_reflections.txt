--When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want to share my codes with other participants or when I want to let them change the
file.
--Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Since other people are also working on the files you want to make sure before any pull
you have the correct one in your repository unless you have to pull request too many
times.
--Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks clones a repository from another github account to my github account
clone clones a remote repository in github to a local machine or a directroy in local machine
to the same machine
we use branch to keep a file and add our changes to it but let other people to have the original file
--What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
if we keep the last state locally then by a new commit we only need to do a push or pull without
need to fetch+merge.
--How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
by sending files.following the changes are difficult but it is more time consuming
