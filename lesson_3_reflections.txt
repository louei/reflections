--When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want to share my codes with other participants or when I want to let them change the
file.
--Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Since other people are also working on the files you want to make sure before any pull
you have the correct one in your repository unless you have to pull request too many
times.
